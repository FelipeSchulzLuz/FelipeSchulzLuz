### Professional Summary

I am a Front-end developer with a strong and diverse background in large-scale projects. My
experience is characterized by close collaboration with multidisciplinary teams and business
units, where effective communication and the use of agile methodologies are essential for
delivering high-quality solutions. I am firmly committed to the continuous development of my
technical and professional skills, prioritizing continuous learning and knowledge sharing with
my colleagues.

Currently, I lead the development of the Dimed Portal at Grupo Panvel, an e-commerce
platform focused on the wholesale market. In this role, I am responsible for the ongoing
maintenance and innovation of the platform, developing new features, and leading projects. I
employ Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) tools and actively
participate in code reviews, supporting the technical growth of my team.
With a solid foundation of 8 years in infrastructure and user support, I transitioned to
Front-end development in 2019. Since then, I have been applying my comprehensive
understanding of technology and support to enhance the end-user experience in all
interfaces I create.
